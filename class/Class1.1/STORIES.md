### As a cool programmer guy I want to have an ability to find the biggest negative value from the provided list of numbers. It will allow me to make my manual calculation faster.

- Requirements:
    - 1. List of numbers in program should contain values (be non-empty).
    - 2. List of numbers in program should be numerical-type and contain only numerical-typed values (e.g ints, floats).
    - 3. User should be able to choose the meaning of 'biggest' before computing, means that either return closest value to 0, or return largest absolute value.
    - 4. User should be prompted that there is ability to choose meaning of 'biggest' before choosing it.
    - 5. Program should print and exit if there are no negative values given.

### As a cool mathematician I want to be able to get roots of the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c. It will allow me to avoid hard calculations related to determinant.

- Requirements:
    - 1. User should be prompted that program solves quadratic equation without calc. determinant by utilizing Viet's theorem.
    - 2. User should be prompted inputs for a, x, b  and c values.
    - 3. Program should check and exit if any of input values is not numerical-typed (e.g ints, floats).
    - 4. Program should check other limitations in according to rules of Viet's theorem and exit with message that error occured in such case.
