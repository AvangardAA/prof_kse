### Hello, this is my repository for prof. programming subject.

Throughout this course i'll use (mostly) modern C++ and where possible try to implement things on CPP2 (aka cppfront).

To write clean and modern code here ill use clangd with clang-tidy linter and config for it is available in this repository.

Little reference about clang-tidy is available here: https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/
